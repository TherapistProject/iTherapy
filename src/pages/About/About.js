          At Healing &#39;we believe there is a better way to do things. A more
          valuable way where customers are earned rather than bought. We&#39;re
          obsessively passionate about it&#39; and our mission is to help people
          achieve it. We focus on search engine optimization. It &#39;s one of
          the least understood and least transparent aspects of great
          marketing&#39; and we see that as an opportunity. We&#39;re excited to
          simplify SEO for everyone through our software, education, and
          community.
